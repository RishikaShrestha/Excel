# Interactive Dashboard using Excel

## Bike Sales in Europe (Sales.csv)

I am currently enhancing my data analytics skills by learning from Alex The Analyst and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. One of my recent projects involved developing an extensive Excel dashboard to analyse data, covering key processes such as data pre-processing, cleaning, and visualisation.

## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx">Bike Dataset</a>

## Data Cleaning Process
Step 1: Created new working sheet so that if we get stuck in one point, we can copy from the original sheet and not download it.

Step 2: Removed all duplicate data.

Step 3: In “Marital Status” column, there was, M and S, which means married and single respectively. So, we renamed them into Married and Single.

Step 4: In “Gender” column, there was F and M, which means Female and Male respectively. So, we renamed them into Female and Male.

Step 5:  For the age, we inserted new column named “Age Brackets”, which is the calculated column of Age. In this column, we have categorised Age into three categories, “Adolescent”, for someone below 31, “Middle Age”, for someone below 54, and “Old Age”, for someone above 54.

## Pivot Table
Pivot Table 1: Average Income per Purchase

Pivot Table 2: Customer Commute

Pivot Table 3: Customer Age Brackets
